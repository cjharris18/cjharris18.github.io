I am also GCIH certified through my involvement in the Cyber Discovery Elite program. This meant I undertook the Sans SEC504 course, which helped further my interest.
In my free time, I enjoy participating in CTF&amp;rsquo;s as well as engaging with platforms like HackTheBox.</description></item><item><title>IntakeCTF - Missing Bytes Writeup</title><link>https://cjharris.co.uk/posts/intakectfmissingbytes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cjharris.co.uk/posts/intakectfmissingbytes/</guid><description>Here is my writeup for the Missing Bytes challenge from the IntakeCTF, hosted by the WMG Cyber Society. An internal CTF hosted at the University of Warwick for the Cyber Security students. I also posted this on their website.
We are told that the PNG image provided won&amp;rsquo;t open.
The first thing we can try is to use the pngcheck command, this will tell us if the PNG is corrupted, and if so hopefully how exactly it is corrupted.</description></item></channel></rss>
