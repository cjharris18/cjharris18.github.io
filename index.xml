All solutions are developed in Python3. The solutions created are the optimised solutions, I am planning on expanding on these with writeups soon.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://cjharris.co.uk/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 21:21:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cjharris.co.uk/about/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Chris Harris, a BT Group Networks Graduate, who works in mobile networks. I am a developer who focuses predominantly on networks and security.
Professionally, I achieved a First Class Honours from the University of Warwick in Cyber Security as well as being GCIH certified through my involvement in the Cyber Discovery Elite program. This meant I undertook the Sans SEC504 course, which helped further my interest.
In my free time, I enjoy participating in CTF&amp;rsquo;s as well as engaging with platforms like HackTheBox.</description></item><item><title>IntakeCTF - Missing Bytes Writeup</title><link>https://cjharris.co.uk/posts/intakectfmissingbytes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cjharris.co.uk/posts/intakectfmissingbytes/</guid><description>Here is my writeup for the Missing Bytes challenge from the IntakeCTF, hosted by the WMG Cyber Society. An internal CTF hosted at the University of Warwick for the Cyber Security students. I also posted this on their website.
We are told that the PNG image provided won&amp;rsquo;t open.
The first thing we can try is to use the pngcheck command, this will tell us if the PNG is corrupted, and if so hopefully how exactly it is corrupted.</description></item><item><title>Templated - HackTheBox Web Challenge Writeup</title><link>https://cjharris.co.uk/posts/templated/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cjharris.co.uk/posts/templated/</guid><description>This writeup covers the steps taken to complete the Templated challenge in the Web category on HackTheBox. The challenge involved exploiting a Template Injection vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) and ultimately retrieve the flag.
Upon starting the challenge, we are provided with the following:
Testing for Template Injection The first thing that stood out was the potential for a Jinja2 Template Injection vulnerability, which is common in web applications that render user input using Jinja2 templates.</description></item></channel></rss>
